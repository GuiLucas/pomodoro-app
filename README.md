## Description 

This app let's you use the pomodoro technique for your todos.

You need to authenticate with your socials to use the app.

When it comes to time management methods, the Pomodoro technique is great. It’s quite effective and
pretty easy to follow. The Pomodoro Process has four primary steps:

• Setting a 25-minute timer for a task to be done.
• Work on the task at hand for 25 minutes until the timer chimers.
• Take a short break (typically for 5-10 minutes).
• After four "pomodoros", take a long break (15-20 minutes)
